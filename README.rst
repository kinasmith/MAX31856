MODIFIED FROM the Nanoshield_Termopar Library
===================

This is the Arduino software library to access the the MAX31856 IC from Maxim Integrated. It can read several types of thermocouples: K, J, N, R, S, T, E, and B.

* Source code: 

Library features include:

* Get external temperature (hot junction)
* Get internal temperature (cold junction)
* Thermocouple type selection
* Continuous conversion mode
* Enable/disable averaging of 2, 4, 8 or 16 samples
* Error checking: open circuit, under/overvoltage and temperature out of range
* Use in either constant conversion (1.2mA quiescient current) or single shot mode (5.5ÂµA quiescient current)
